**Mob programming** is a method of [working collaboratively](/thoughts/working-collaboratively) in which a small team of
software developers all work on one problem together with one person at the keyboard at a time. This can help prevent
knowledge silos and increase knowledge sharing throughout the team that is working within a given context.

A common concern that people share with this style of working is that it feels as though the speed at which the team can
deliver results must be slower in order to accommodate this style of working, because it requires everyone to be
together at once instead of dividing the members of the team into individual work streams to work on multiple things at
the same time (sometimes even incorrectly characterized as a [divide and conquer](/thoughts/divide-and-conquer)
approach). It is true that is an expensive way of writing code, but to truly consider velocity and cost, the total
picture must also be considered. Mob programming practically eliminates the code review process as the code review has
taken place completely within the code writing process itself. The amount of time that anyone on the team will need to
review that code with others is also reduced, especially if they brought in product owners and UX designers throughout
the process, having them join the working group.

And the speed at which code is written is a very misleading metric, because, ideally, the code that you produce through
mob programming needs less rework, and less attention to improve in future iterations, because the quality--which also
is tricky to measure--is ideally higher.
