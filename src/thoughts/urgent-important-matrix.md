The **Urgent-Important matrix** is a decision matrix that is used for time management. It is a useful tool for managing
a to-do list that has become increasingly large and determining some steps to take to come up with a smaller backlog of
items. Determine, for each item, how urgent it is and how important it is.

<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<th scope="col">Urgent</th>
<th scope="col">Not Urgent</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Important</th>
<td>Do it</td>
<td>Schedule it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">Not Important</th>
<td>Delegate it</td>
<td>Drop it</td>
</tr>
</table>

To illustrate the difference, imagine yourself walking into your kitchen as you take a lunch break from work:

- The need to eat something is **Urgent and Important**. Until something is eaten to satisfy your hunger, your
  physiological health is not being served. It may cause immediate issues with your ability to focus on tasks until
  addressed and eating the right thing will help make sure that you can maintain a good mental state for several hours.
  Eating is something you should be **doing** while you are here.
- While you are in the kitchen, you may notice a mess from the last time you made something. Cleaning that up is
  **Important but not Urgent**. It can continue to wait, and there is no strict deadline that really makes sense, but
  completing that task will really help eventually, and it should be done eventually. Cleaning is something that we
  should consider **scheduling** with a clear plan to complete soon.
- Before we can get to anything in the kitchen itself, you may get a private chat notification from a co-worker that
  something has come up at work. For you, at this moment, this task is **Urgent but not Important**. If someone is
  expecting an answer from you, it is polite to respond to that person, but you deserve to have a lunch break, so kindly
  respond and see if they can get help from someone else for the time being. In effect, this would be to see if the
  urgent request can be **delegated** to someone else while you are away.
- You get another notification on your phone, but it is a post from a breaking news app. This is **neither Urgent nor
  Important**. There are several things that can be done instead and this is time that could be spent doing something
  much more useful. You may feel the need to spend several minutes reading this and other articles, but this task would
  be better off **dropping** all together.

Work that exists in the **Important but Not Urgent** quadrant can represent a problem if the schedule is delayed too
much and can eventually turn into emergencies that move into the **Urgent and Important** quadrant.
