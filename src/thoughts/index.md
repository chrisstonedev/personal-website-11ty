Here are some thoughts that I have on various subjects. As opposed to writing complete blog articles, this format allows
me to write as much or as little on any topic about which I feel like writing.

On pages where I share an opinion, I do not intend to represent a final verdict on a subject, nor do I intend to
represent the thoughts of any other people or entity.

These pages are also intended to grow over time and link to one another as connections between concepts reveal
themselves.
