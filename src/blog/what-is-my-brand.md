title: What Is My Brand?

Who are you? How do you present yourself to the world? What is the thing for which someone would go to you for help?
What makes you special?

I don't know. I think I know who I am, but communicating my value to the world can be difficult. Am I defined by my
hobbies? What about the projects on which I have happened to work? When I communicate at work and through social media,
am I using consistent messaging that is consistent with my brand, even if I am not sure how to put my brand into words?

I have wanted to have some sort of blog on a website for some time, but questions such as these have made that first
step difficult. It seems appropriate to make that the first subject of my blog.
