**Notes** is an encyclopedia of various things I have learned and feel is worth sharing. I try to cite sources when I feel it is relevant, but I am not necessarily trying to be a source of truth on any particular subject. Some notes may be referenced in some of my more personal [thoughts](/thoughts). These pages are also intended to grow over time and link to one another as connections between concepts reveal themselves.
