**Break the pots and sink the boat** is a literal translation of Chinese proverb 破釜沉舟[^1]. It can be compared to the idiom "to burn one's boats." It is based on a story of an army that, after crossing a river, had destroyed most of their provisions as well as their only way to cross the river and return. They would commit to the path that had gone down and eliminated the idea of going backward.

The proverb can be used in project management when evaluating possible approaches that can be made. Sometimes, it can be very valuable to consider multiple options and have backup plans, but when one path is clearly the optimal path, spending extra time to support a possible inferior backup plan may not be the right call.
