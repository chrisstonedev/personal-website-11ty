Remote mob programming is a practice in which all software developers on a team, even if they live across the country or
around the world, take turns writing code on one task at a time in an online video call for an entire day, every day. It
may sound tedious, draining, or counterproductive, but it is how I have worked for over two years now, and I believe
that the best code is written when everyone is working together. I will share my personal experiences from several teams
that have adopted remote mob programming, covering both the benefits and the challenges. Working collaboratively can
help remove knowledge silos, eliminate asynchronous code review processes, and foster better interpersonal
understanding, but making a permanent shift in how a team operates can be complicated and stressful at times. I will
highlight some techniques that all software teams can start trying today for more effective pairing and collaborating,
and I might even possibly convince you just how valuable remote mob programming can be.
