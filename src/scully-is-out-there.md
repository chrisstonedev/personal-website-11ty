Angular is a powerful web application framework that helps us build impressive enterprise applications, but as static "Jamstack" sites grow in popularity, those who maintain Angular apps may feel the grass is greener with other technologies that are optimized for faster page rendering. Fortunately, the open source tool Scully is a static site generator that works with Angular to pre-render content and deliver fast and secure websites that can still connect to APIs to render dynamic content as needed. In this talk, I will demonstrate Scully by showing how it can be added to an existing Angular project, explain how it actually works behind the scenes to produce the new static assets, and recommend some good practices for incrementally improving your Angular applications.

This talk has been given at the following events:

- [Scenic City Summit 2022](https://sceniccitysummit.com/2022-schedule/) (July 2022; in-person)
- [Atlanta Developers' Conference 2022](https://www.atldevcon.com/schedule) (September 2022; in-person)
- [Connect.Tech 2022](https://2022.connect.tech/session/?id=351073) (November 2022; in-person)
