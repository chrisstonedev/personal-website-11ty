**Contempt culture** is a term about the communities we build based on things we agree to dislike. Aurynn Shaw described this term and has given talks on the subject.

I have worked at multiple companies that use Microsoft tools and the .NET platform, where it has not been uncommon to hear someone say something bad about Java and how they would never want to work with Java. I have also attended Devnexus, a large Java-focused conference here in Atlanta, and I have heard attendees and speakers make fun of .NET and say that they would never want to work with .NET.
