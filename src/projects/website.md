**chrisstone.dev** is my personal website. It currently uses Eleventy as a static site generator. It features
information on talks I have presented as part of my technical speaking as well as projects I currently maintain. It also
has a section dedicated to thoughts on various topics, ranging from summaries of certain concepts to blog-like articles.

The website is deployed on Netlify.
