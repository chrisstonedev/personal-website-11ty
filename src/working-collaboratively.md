**Working collaboratively** is a style of working in which everyone brings their strengths to the table. Ideally,
instead of seeing certain people as senior or as junior to one another, and instead of thinking about a dynamic through
a lens of people whose skills are lacking or those whose skills are overflowing, we can consider that everyone has much
that they can give to the team. Some people in the group might have more years of experience, but everyone can have a
slightly different focus and have picked different disciplines, different languages, different frameworks, and different
paradigms to follow and for which to have a passion.

When Daniel Kwan, co-director of *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, gave his acceptance speech for Best Director at
the 95th Academy Awards, he viewed the accomplishment not as an individual one but as a result of the work that everyone
in the film put into it:[^1]

> If our movie has greatness and genius, it is only because \[the cast and crew\] have greatness and genius flowing
> through their hearts and souls and minds, and they gave that precious gift to our film. The world is opening up to the
> fact that genius does not stem from individuals like us onstage, but rather, genius emerges from the collective. We
> are all products of our context. We are all descendants of something and someone. \[...\] There is greatness in every
> single person. It doesn't matter who they are. You have a genius that is waiting to erupt. You just need to find the
> right people to unlock that. Thank you so much to everyone who has unlocked my genius.

At the Ineos 1:59 Challenge, Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to ever run a marathon distance in under two hours.
Though his accomplishment is seen by many as an individual achievement, he has always given much credit to the people
who have helped and aided the process, seeing it as a group effort and achievement. While training for a previous
attempt as part of the Breaking2 project, he said the following in a documentary film:[^2]

> This is teamwork. I get information from the scientists, information from the management, from the coaching system. So
> it's really a circle. You cannot train alone and expect to run a fast time. There's a formula: 100% of me is nothing
> compared to 1% of the whole team. And that's teamwork. That's what I value.
