**Working collaboratively** means bringing workers together and getting the input of many people into the process and effort of the work. Everyone brings their strengths to the table. Some people may be more junior or more senior than others, and some people may have more or less relevant skills to the task at hand, but everyone still has something unique to contribute to the work. Some people in the group might have more years of experience, but everyone can have a slightly different focus and have picked different disciplines, different languages, different frameworks, and different paradigms to follow and for which to have a passion.

Leaders of teams that value collaborative work will often practice [selfless leadership](/selfless-leadership).
