These open source projects demonstrate things that I have learned outside job experience to continue my skills.

## Website

**chrisstone.dev** is my personal website. It currently uses Eleventy as a static site generator. It features information on talks I have presented as part of my technical speaking as well as projects I currently maintain. It also has a section dedicated to thoughts on various topics, ranging from summaries of certain concepts to blog-like articles. The website is deployed on Netlify. The website is open source and can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisstonedev/personal-website-11ty).
