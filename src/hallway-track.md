The **hallway track** at a conference refers to time spent outside of planned sessions to connect with and network with other people. Its name evokes the idea that, even when sessions are planned in different rooms or spaces with different tracks, people have the freedom to not attend any of the sessions and use that time in other ways, though spending time between sessions can also be considered as attending the hallway track.

Open Space events are conferences in which the entire event is composed of hallway tracks as no sessions are scheduled in advance and the topics and structure are defined during the day and are flexible to the needs of those who attend.
