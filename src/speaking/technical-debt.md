Have you ever taken a shortcut to complete a task, assuring yourself that you would go back and clean it up and do it
the right way later when you had the time? In software, this is called “technical debt,” and when it piles up, it can
make code hard to read and maintain. Soon enough, the cost to fix these problems can become too high, and convincing
your team to take action becomes increasingly difficult. In this talk, we will discuss the different types of technical
debt, how to convince other people in the organization of the importance of making regular “minimum payments,” and some
creative strategies to keep in mind for software projects with excessive “accrued interest.”
