title: Why Code Alone When You Could Be Remote Mob Programming?
date: 2023-04-05

Remote mob programming is a practice in which a software development team, comprised of people from across the country
or even around the world, takes turns writing code on one task at a time in an online video call for an entire day,
every day. It may sound tedious or unproductive or draining, but it is how I have worked for nearly two years now, and I
do not plan on going back anytime soon. I will share my personal experiences from several companies that have taken on
remote mob programming and how it has helped remove knowledge silos and asynchronous code review processes while
providing a connected experience within and across modern remote teams. I will share my stories and cautionary advice
from introducing remote mob programming practices on various teams. If you have ever been curious how remote mob
programming can become a viable way of working, this is the talk for you!
