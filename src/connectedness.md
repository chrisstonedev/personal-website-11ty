**Connectedness**[^1] is one of 34 themes in the [CliftonStrengths](/cliftonstrengths) assessment, belonging to the
Relationship Building domain. More information about how this theme is defined can be found on
their [website](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252197/connectedness-theme.aspx).

Connectedness is important to me in a working context. To me, it speaks to taking the backgrounds and skills that we all
bring to the table to help one another but then putting ego aside and celebrate the combination of everything that went
into the process to create something that no person could have created all on their own. The work becomes a product of
the collective. It means that [working collaboratively](/working-collaboratively) is important, and it is important to
make sure it is done thoughtfully and carefully.

One paragraph on the official website in particular speaks to me:[^2]

> If we are all part of a larger picture, then we must not harm others because we will be harming ourselves. We must not
> exploit because we will be exploiting ourselves. Your awareness of these responsibilities creates your value system.

We must be very aware of and work against systems of oppression. Designing for accessibility to create things that
everyone can experience is very important and can never be ignored. We must create diverse, equitable, and inclusive
environments in which everyone feels they belong, and that can only be done by analyzing and dismantling our explicit
and implicit biases. And we can—and we must—refuse to build or maintain systems of fraud or war.
