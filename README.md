# Personal Website (Eleventy)

My personal website was previously written in Angular and used the Scully library to turn it into a static site. Wanting
to even more easily produce a static site that did not need hardly any JavaScript code at all, I started testing new
versions with various frameworks. This repository tracks my learning progress of the **Eleventy** framework with a
rewrite of my personal site as the proof of concept. This proof of concept proved to be easy to use, quick to build, and
satisfying to see results, so it replaced my existing Angular site.
