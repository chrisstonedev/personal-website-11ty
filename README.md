# Personal Website (11ty)

I am currently researching several Jamstack site generators that I could use over my Angular/Scully combination for my
current personal website. This repository tracks my learning progress of the **11ty** framework with a rewrite of my
personal site as the proof of concept.

If it turns out that this version of the website might be good enough to be able to replace the original site, then that
will be done.

## Development

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to serve changes.

## Deployment

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm run build` to build the application. Upload all files in
the `public/` folder to deploy.
